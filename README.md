Magic Eight Ball (8-ball ?!)
---
Allows a user to enter a question and get 1 of 20 responses back. You will never get the same response twice in a row, and your past 3 questions will be listed on the side of the page. These questions are stored in your localStorage (with compatible browsers) and so your questions and responses will persist over time. If you do not have localStorage, then the questions will only be relevant until you leave or refresh the page.

Developed using Javascript, using HTML5 Canvas for the 8-ball display.
